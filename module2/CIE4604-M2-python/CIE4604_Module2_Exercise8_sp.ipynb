    " \n",
    "GPS and other GNSS satellite signals are reflected by the Earthâ€™s oceans. A GNSS-R receiver on board a satellite in a low Earth orbit (LEO) is able to receive both the direct signal from a GNSS satellite, as well as the signal reflected by the surface of the Earth. This will provide very useful information on the Sea state and level in particular.\n",

    "The main question is how to find the coordinates of the Specular Reflection Point area on the Earth's surface from the coordinates of the transmitting (GPS) and receiving (LEO) satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of the transmitting and receiving satellites are given. The follow for example from computations with Two-Line Elements. The coordinates should be in the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) reference frame. The coordinates may be Cartesian coordinates or the spherical latitude, longitude and height.\n",
