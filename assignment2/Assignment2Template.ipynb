    "# Assignment 2 - GNSS-Reflectometry simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "GPS and other GNSS satellite signals are reflected by the Earth’s oceans. A GNSS-R(eflectrometry) receiver on board a satellite in a low Earth orbit (LEO) is able to receive both the **direct** signal from a GNSS satellite, as well as the signal **reflected** by the surface of the Earth. This will provide very useful information on the Sea state and level in particular\n",

    "For this assignment you are given the task to simulate a GNSS-R(eflectometry) experiment on board the International Space Station (ISS). \n",
    "\n",
    "All the Python scripts can be found in `CIE4604-M2-python` that you can download from Brightspace. For the assignment you need the following modules\n",
    "- `tleplot.py`\n",
    "- `crsutil.py`\n",
    "- `specularpoint.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to have `simplekml` installed (See exercise 6). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `CIE4604-M2-python` download comes with 8 exercises in Jupyter notebooks. We suggest that you study the Jupyter notebooks first and do the exercises. These already contain a lot of useful material for the assignment, some of which can be re-purposed for the assignment. An other option is to do this assignment in parallel with the exercises."

    "The GNSS-R receiver on board the ISS uses two antenna’s, one **upward looking** standard **omnidirectional** antenna for the **direct** signals, and a specially designed **downward looking** antenna for the **reflected** signals. The opening angle of downward antenna (field of view) is not yet decided: the final value will depend on the outcome of the simulation, and will be a trade-off between received power and coverage."
